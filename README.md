## Overview

**Friend Finder** is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The app allows users to search for and add friends, manage their friend lists, view user profiles, and receive friend recommendations based on mutual connections and interests. The platform is optimized for performance, offering a smooth user experience with a responsive design.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
- **Sign Up:** Users can create an account by providing a unique username and password.
- **Login:** Secure login functionality to allow users to access their account.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to secure user sessions, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected routes.

### 2. Home Page
- Displays a list of 10-15 users available for connecting. A button labeled **"Explore More"** allows users to be redirected to a dedicated **Discover Users** page where more users are available for connection.
- Shows friend recommendations based on mutual connections and interests directly on the dashboard.
- Displays the user's current friend list with a button **"View All Friends"** that redirects to a **Friends List** page for managing connections.
- Includes links to **"Friend Requests Sent"** and **"Friend Requests Received"** pages, allowing easy navigation to manage outgoing and incoming friend requests.

### 3. Add Friend Feature
- **Search Users:** Users can search for other registered users through a search bar.
- **Send Friend Requests:** Allows users to send and receive friend requests.
- **Manage Requests:** Users can accept or reject incoming friend requests via a user-friendly interface.

### 4. Friend Recommendation System
- **Mutual Friends:** The system suggests potential friends based on the number of mutual connections.
- **Common Interests:** If interests are part of the user profile, the recommendation system can use this information to suggest friends with similar hobbies or interests.
- **Display Recommendations:** Friend recommendations are dynamically displayed on the user's dashboard for ease of discovery.

### 5. User Profiles
- **Profile Creation:** Each user has a profile that can include details like their interests, hobbies, and mutual connections.
- **View Profiles:** Users can view the profiles of other users, allowing them to see information like interests, mutual friends, and more before sending a friend request.
  
## State Management
- The application leverages **Redux** for managing global application state, ensuring smooth data flow between components and efficient handling of user interactions.

## RESTful API Implementation
- The backend implements **RESTful APIs** to facilitate communication between the client and server. The APIs handle functionalities such as:
  - **User Authentication**
  - **Friend Requests Management**
  - **Friend Recommendation**
  - **User Search and Discovery**
  - **Profile Viewing**
  
  This modular approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Technical Requirements

### Languages & Frameworks:
- **Frontend:** Built using React.js, with reusable components, hooks for state management, and modern CSS for styling.
- **Backend:** Developed using Node.js with the Express.js framework to handle server-side logic, routing, and API creation.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used as the primary database to store user data, friend lists, and connection recommendations.
- **Authentication:** JWT is implemented to secure user sessions and APIs, providing a robust layer of security.

### Version Control:
- The application is managed using Git for source code version control, ensuring development tracking and collaboration.
